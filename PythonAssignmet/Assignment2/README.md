To determine whether a number is odd or even:
Use the modulus operator (%) along with an if condition. When a number is divided by 2 using the modulus operator, if the result is 0, the number is even. Otherwise, it's odd. This method allows us to check whether a number is odd or even using simple logic.

To calculate the sum of integers:
The range() function is used to generate a sequence of numbers within a specified range. By iterating through this range and adding each number, we can calculate the total sum of the integers.
